                    The Mazda6, just another midsize sedan in the whole field of midsize sedans out there.
                    “How do you hide a stolen cow? Hide it in a field of other cows!” This car doesn’t quite fit that
                    adage. The first thing that tells you that this cow is neon pink, orange, and green in this field of
                    beige cows is the aesthetics. This car is absolutely drop­dead gorgeous. Mazda did quite a
                    good job at molding a midsize sedan in their Kodo design language, describing how the soul
                    can be in motion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    And, my, the soul is really in motion.
                    </p>

                    <h1>The Mazda6 comes with chrome details and a beautiful hood</h1>

                    <p>
                    Let’s first take a look at the front of the 6. It starts quite flat at the front, but that doesn’t
                    hinder a thing. The grille seems to smirk, like it has something to hide under the lingerie­-like
                    clothing. The chrome strip that creates the smirk and the quite threatening, yet subtly integrated
                    headlights. The bottom grille, along with the grille and headlights look like they want to say
                    something. That something, is a look of “I’m going to get you, no matter what, and I’ll look good
                    doing it!” I think it befits the car’s body quite well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The hood is quite long, everything ahead of the A­pillar is long and lanky. The subtle
                    fender flares on the front make the car have an aggressive stance in the front, and make the car
                    seem to move even when it is standing still, yet adding crumple zones for safety, looks really
                    excellent in my opinion. That’s Kodo for you. The front fog lamps also curve into the front fender,
                    which ripples into the fender flares, giving a sense of starting off where the front fascia stopped.
                    The hood, bulging and creating a separation between the aggressive side profile and the roof,
                    works well. The bulge helps you think the car is fast and that it has a lot of power underneath, alas,
                    the 2.5 liter Skyactiv engine doesn’t make that much, it does well.</p>
                    <p>

                    <h2>An aerodynamic exterior</h2>

                    Let’s quit harping on the engine and keep moving back. At the A­pillar, the fender flare
                    tapers off into the door lines. The doors have a soft flowing curve, at top, and more pronounced
                    at the bottom, shaped like the wind would flow over the car. It looks quite nice. The windows
                    form a stretched teardrop shape, at it’s highest at the B­pillar. The raked windshield molds into
                    the roof, at it’s highest at the B­pillar as the windows. The windows and the roof have a
                    marginally thick bezel between them, I’d like it to be smaller, but roof crush tests for rollovers
                    and general safety hinder that fact. But this car is an IIHS Top Safety Pick +, which is their
                    highest rating. That’s quite good.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Past the B­pillar, everything tapers off. There are also a couple of fender flares at the rear,
                    although not as pronounced as the front, it still adds a curvature, and looks so good in the
                    process. The trunk is short, and the hood is long, it fits the older muscle car philosophy of “long
                    hood, short deck” to a tee. That always looks good in my book and if you flip it around you get a
                    bulbous trunk section with a too­short hood, and that’s not the best to look at, *cough cough*
                    Ford Fiesta sedan *cough*.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The rear fascia also looks really good, like the front. The tail lights also look aggressive, with a
                    chrome strip on top, which gives me a look of, “I’m gone, I did my job at being better than you.”
                    That may seem arrogant but it still makes my eyes attracted to the car, like Adderall and college
                    students for example. It looks quite good in the back, although the rear reflectors tried. They
                    tried. But they seem like they were stuck there, but a 1­inch recess will make it look good? It’s
                    OK, but I’d like it more blended in the bottom left and right of the bumper, below the rear
                    fenders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The choice of dual 5­spoke wide wheels on this car make it look sporty, like it can take a corner
                    with authority, and it can, but I’m not talking about the driving dynamics here. They blend into
                    the rest of the car just extremely well. The 17 inch wheels look good, but the 19 inch alloys with
                    the more low ­profile tires match the sporty look a lot more.

                    <h3>Smart Interior Details in the Mazda6</h3>

                    <p>
                    The car looks excellent on the outside, what about the inside? It still looks really good.</p>
                    <p>
                    As I look at the driver’s perspective, everything seems well laid out. Everything either seems round or angular, and it all
                    works. Every bit of it but one. The heads­up display. It seems to stick out like a sore thumb and
                    it doesn’t seem right, as below it are one of the nicest sets of analog gauges on a car. Can’t you
                    just tilt your head down 15 degrees? Anyway, the infotainment system, although looking like it
                    should retract, still looks like it belongs, as there isn’t a place where you can really mount a
                    single or double­DIN traditional stereo anywhere. It’s all for HVAC controls and storage, and it
                    just works.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The door panels are angular and look good and well matched to the dash. I look at the junction
                    between dash and door panel rather seriously. It works. There is a stylistic line and it makes it
                    seems the car bends around the passengers. It looks good. The seats look comfortable, and
                    sporty, and belong. Everything is bolstered, and makes the car seem like it is sporty and can
                    take a corner without you having to grab the ‘OH SH*T’ handles or the steering wheel to hold on
                    during a corner. It looks quite good inside.</p>
                    <p>
                    The Mazda6. It looks really, really, really good. If I would buy a midsize sedan, I would buy a
                    Mazda6. The looks alone are just awe inducing, and I’m not going to start on the drive. Only if
                    Mazda would finally come out with the turbodiesel already.
                    </p>
