                    <p>
                        “Yes sir!” the officer chuckled to himself, following a low whistle, as he sauntered over to my lowered window.
                        “We’ll see you coming from a mile away in this thing, good luck!” he wasn’t wrong. At 17 feet long and 6 feet wide,
                        coming in at 4200 pounds and sporting a burn-your-eyes-out green paint job, this 2015 Dodge Challenger R/T Scat Pack
                        was hard to miss. Rolling through that traffic stop, you could almost hear the dozen or so cops making a mental
                        note of what I looked like and what I was driving. I was officially marked.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For 2015, we got some pretty crazy stuff from our pals at Dodge. No doubt you’ve heard about the 707
                        horsepower monstrosities they’ve dubbed Hellcats, whom many now claim sit on top of the muscle car throne.
                        I want to challenge (heh) that claim, not because the Hellcat isn’t the fastest or most powerful, no, I’m saying
                        that the Hellcat can’t wear that crown because they aren’t actually muscle cars. Ok, hold on, put down your
                        pitchforks and let me explain: the Hellcat does not hold true to the classic muscle car formula. If you look
                        back at the 1960’s, a muscle car was born when a manufacturer pulled the engine out of their full sized boat
                        and put it into the body of a mid sized coupe (for power to weight ratios) then made sure that the interiors
                        stayed fairly basic in order to keep costs down. The end result was something cheap and fast that just about
                        anyone could afford. The Hellcat might be fast, but at $60k as a starting price and with power/automatic/leather
                        wrapped everything as standard inside the cabin, it sure isn’t cheap or sparsely equipped.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I like to think of the Scat Pack as a sort of super duper track pack for the R/T trim level. Here’s what you get:
                        the massive 392 cubic inch (6.4L in non-American) HEMI V8 taken from the boys over at Chrysler’s SRT division,
                        which is now good for 485 horsepower and 475 foot pounds of twisting power (over the 372hp and 400ft-lb that comes
                        with the regular R/T’s 5.7L). Underneath the Scat Pack you’ll find some pretty stiff Bilstein shocks, placing the
                        Scat Pack around half an inch lower than it’s lesser R/T brother. Behind the 20 inch cast aluminium rims you’ll find
                        slotted rotors and 4 pot Brembo calipers, which are actually straight off the 2011-2014 Challenger SRT (for ‘15 the
                        SRTs all got fancy new 6 piston units and slightly larger rotors). Wrapped around those rims are Goodyear Eagle F1
                        Supercars, sized 245/45, a tire that I can promise you, speaking from experience, will not last long with that big 392
                        and a heavy right foot telling it what to do.
                    </p>

                    <img class="articleImage" src="/images/posts/2015/8/15ChallengerRTScat/frontf.jpg">

                    <p>
                        Transmission options for the Scat Pack consist of a ZF HP8 eight speed automatic unit, or the Tremec TR-6060 six speed
                        manual. This specific Challenger we’re testing comes with the six speed three pedal setup. The Tremec TR-6060 is very
                        well suited to this car, with heavy, albeit short throws, that all end with a satisfying and reassuring thud as the
                        stick slides into place. Keeping in character, the clutch is also fairly heavy, but not uncomfortably so. Generally
                        speaking, this is a very user friendly manual transmission.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The transmission is not perfect though: Tremec implemented a “feature” into the 6060 that I found to be very annoying.
                        Essentially, when the car is moving at the perfect speed, the engine is revving at the ideal mark, and the computer
                        determines that everything is right in the world, the transmission blocks you out of 2nd and 3rd gear . This means that
                        sometimes, when that very specific list of requirements is met, you might be leaving from a redlight, attempt the shift
                        from 1st to 2nd, only to feel the gate for 2nd being obstructed by something that’s sloped in a way that funnels your gear
                        selector into 4th. The whole experience is incredibly invasive and jarring at first, but after it happens a few times and
                        you get used to it, it just becomes an annoyance. Dodge and Tremec both claim that this feature is designed to help with
                        fuel economy, but I fear that the annoyances involved with this system outweigh whatever gains are had in fuel economy.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The big V8 equipped Dodge Challenger fared better than expected when it came time to look at fuel economy. Dodge
                        claims that the 6.4L V8 equipped Challenger is capable of seeing 14 MPG city and 23 highway, which might even be
                        conservative. Over a 350 mile trip, maybe 80% highway, I was able to average 25 miles to the gallon with normal driving.
                        Even after a few thousand more miles, I’ve rarely seen the average dip below 15, even after a bit of, erm, enthusiastic
                        driving around town. Those numbers aren’t terrible when you consider what the Challenger has to work with.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Performance wise, the R/T Scat Pack might look a little underwhelming when compared to its 707 horsepower big brother,
                        but don’t be fooled, the Scat Pack is still more than respectable. Dodge claims a 0-60 run in the mid 4 second range,
                        the quarter mile marker comes up in the mid 12s, and that there’s an aerodynamically limited top speed of 182 miles per hour.
                        Not terrible for a car that can be had for under forty grand.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The handling is not exactly class leading. The 245 width tires are too skinny for how much torque is being pumped out, and
                        you’ll find them pulling and fighting for traction as they try to keep this monster of a car in line around a higher speed
                        corner. Body roll is surprisingly kept to a minimal, but it is still noticeable. The Brembos are great for typical daily
                        driving, although there have been some reports of overheating due to continuous hard driving. I have not personally found any
                        issues with the brakes,but  if you’re the kind of person who frequently does autocross days or spends a lot of time ripping up
                        canyons, some of these things may be issues for you. If you’re like me and only want a car like this for cruising, burnouts,
                        and drag racing, I doubt you’ll have many qualms.
                    </p>

                        This Challenger has a few tricks up its sleeve when it comes to doing things that you probably should not be doing on public roads.
                        First, you have the “SPORT” button. Fairly simple feature, in the Scat Pack it gives the electric power steering a tighter and
                        heavier feel, along with improving the throttle response, and partially turning the traction control off, leaving stability control
                        on as an attempt to prevent you from making a boo boo. I found myself reaching for the Sport button, under the push button ignition,
                        almost every time the HEMI roared to life.
                    </p>

                    <img class="articleImage" src="/images/posts/2015/8/15ChallengerRTScat/sideprofilef.jpg">

                    <p>
                        Hitting the “SUPER TRACK PACK” button directly under the sport button is how you activate launch control. It’s a simple system, you
                        pick the RPM you want to launch at, depress your clutch, mash the gas and then dump the clutch. Honestly, I found launch control
                        less than impressive in terms of times, but the smoke was always spectacular. After a few minutes of practice it wasn’t hard to beat
                        the launch control by taking off the old fashioned way. Wheelhop can be pretty harsh when launching hard, and can make for a bumpy
                        or even squirrely launches if you’re brave enough to completely disable traction control.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Dodge’s Performance Pages are a feature you can access either through settings on the uConnect screen or by pressing the Super Track
                        Pack button mentioned above. I could almost write an entire article on the features contained within these pages alone, so I’ll just
                        touch on them here. Firstly, they keep records, such as your best 0-60 run, your best 1/8th mile, your highest recorded speed, max g
                        forces experienced, and so on. Performance Pages also provides you with constantly changing image of what’s going on with your car,
                        such as engine power output, intake air temperature, G forces currently being applied in any direction, tire air pressure, and gauges
                        to monitor just about anything you could think of. My personal favorite feature is probably the christmas tree that pops up on your
                        dash when you tell the car that you’re going to do a ¼ mile, ⅛ mile, or 0-60 run. You can view all of this information either on a
                        screen in your gauge cluster, or on the big touchscreen display on your dash. I’m not entirely sure I would trust the timers for any
                        official record keeping, but for messing around (on an enclosed course, obviously) they work perfectly fine.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We couldn’t have a write up on this Challenger without mentioning the looks now, could we? For 2015 Dodge gave the Challenger its
                        first major update since its reintroduction to the market in 2008. With the classic pony car silhouette, with the long hood, short
                        decklid, and low slung profile, the overall shape of the Challenger has not changed much for 2015, but the smaller details have been
                        revised. The updated design takes styling cues from the 1971 Challenger, with a dual snorkel grille implemented into an updated rear
                        fascia. Retained is the classic quad headlight layout, only now modernized with halo lamps. The hood on non-SRT Challengers resembles
                        older model’s, but that too has been revised in design.  Dodge did away with the famous single bar taillight look and replaced it
                        with an equally retro and arguably sportier split taillight design, surrounded in gloss black. All these updates are welcome
                        improvements over the 2014 model, giving the car an overall slightly more premium look.
                    </p>

                    <img class="articleImage" src="/images/posts/2015/8/15ChallengerRTScat/rearf.jpg">

                    <p>
                        This specific Challenger came to me painted in the aforementioned bright green, which Dodge has nostalgically named Sublime Green,
                        as an homage to a similar paint option of the same name you could get on the Challenger in 1971. With this Scat Pack came the Scat
                        Pack appearance package, which includes the following changes: The snorkels on the grille, and the fuel filler cap, have been
                        changed from billet silver to a gloss black. The rear lip is also now matte black, with a matching black bumblebee stripe goes
                        across the rear decklid and down both rear fenders, ending where the rear bumper cover begins. The appearance package also includes
                        your choice of two unique rim options, one entirely flat black and the other gloss black with silver, which is what his car came with.
                        Regardless of what aesthetics package a Scat Pack comes equipped with, they can all be identified by a small badge on either fender,
                        of an angry wheeled bee with red “6.4L” lettering underneath.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The most commonly requested update for the Challenger was probably the interior. While the exterior of the Challenger has always
                        been stylish, the interior felt outdated the day it showed up back in 2008. By 2014 the Challenger’s interior was borderline laughable,
                        falling far behind the competition.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But no more! For 2015 the interior has been completely revised. Gone are the harsh, squeaky plastics, the ugly dash and gauge cluster,
                        the ancient infotainment system. Most high traffic areas of the interior now feature soft touch materials. Speaking of the dash, which
                        now wraps around the driver, it features a large 8.4 inch touchscreen infotainment system, running Chrysler’s exceptional uConnect
                        software. The gauge cluster has also been reworked, now a tasteful blend of retro and modern, mirroring the rest of the car. The gauges
                        are unmistakably inspired by classic Mopar interiors of the early 70s.
                    </p>

                    <img class="articleImage" src="/images/posts/2015/8/15ChallengerRTScat/sunsetFrontf.jpg">

                    <p>
                        The outside of the updated Challenger looks pleasant, as does the interior, but looking outside from the inside is a challenge on it’s
                        own. The high beltline and low roofline equate to some very shallow windows, and the large C pillar coupled with a small rear window
                        result in poor rearward visibility. Due to the low seating position and long hood, even forward visibility isn’t perfect. Blind spot
                        detection helps, but even that isn’t foolproof.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When it comes to the comfort and cabin space, the Challenger’s large profile is definitely beneficial. My 6’4” father could drive the car comfortably
                        with plenty of room to spare. Even the rear seats are spacious, at least compared to other coupes. It might be worth noting that the
                        Challenger actually has a full, 3 person bench seat in the rear, as opposed to the 2+2 setup both the Mustang and Camaro use.  The seats
                        are aggressively bolstered, yet comfortable enough to make long road trips not only bearable, but pleasant, even with the harsh suspension.
                        My only complaint with the interior is the cup holder placement, located directly behind the shifter, your morning coffee may intrude on any
                        fun you might try to have on your commute to work.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Regarding long term reliability, it’s never a bad idea to be cautious when looking at a manufacturer with a track record as dubious as Chrysler’s.
                        While I’m currently tentatively in the “Come on guys, Chrysler isn’t that bad” camp, this example we’re reviewing has had a couple relevant
                        hiccups. After the car’s first time driving in the rain, the lense of the backup camera actually filled with water, rendering it useless. It
                        was a fairly quick and easy fix, but was still a big enough issue to require an afternoon at my friendly neighborhood Chrysler dealership.
                        Also, at about 5000 miles into the Challenger’s life, a small squeak has developed around the shifter while in third gear. While small, it’s
                        annoying enough that I’ll find myself spending as little time as possible in third gear. So far it’s been nothing more than an annoyance, but
                        I’ll be sure to update this review and change my aforementioned camp membership if the issue develops into something more serious.

                        Probably the most important feature of the Scat Pack, however, isn’t the big engine or fancy tires, but the options. There are a lot of
                        options to select when buying a Scat Pack, you can have heated leather seats, heated leather steering wheel, automatic high beams, automatic
                        windshield wipers, the list goes on and on, almost nothing comes standard. But wait, isn’t that a bad thing? Shouldn’t you want as many
                        features as possible as standard? Well, normally that would be a ‘Yes,’ but the Scat Pack is not a normal car. See, by making everything
                        optional, it leaves the base price of this trim level at just $38K USD. That’s almost 10 grand cheaper than the SRT, and over 20 grand cheaper
                        than the Hellcat. Putting all the go-fast parts in a basically equipped car, sound familiar? Yup, Dodge took a page out of Classic Muscle Cars
                        101. By having such a low starting price, Dodge has made nearly 500 horsepower available to the average American car buyer, which I think is a
                        beautiful thing.
